### Greetings!!

This repository contains the code for simple CRUD application using MySQL as the database, Express JS and Node JS for the backend and React JS for the frontend along with Bootstrap and React Bootstrap for styling.

To get started, clone this repository in your computer.

### Installing the required dependencies

For client side,
```powershell 
cd client
npm install
```

For backend side,
```powershell
cd server 
npm install 
```

Now all the dependencies have been installed. 

### To start the server,
```powershell
cd server
npm run dev
```
This starts the server for both frontend as well as the backend.

#### You can even start the server for backend and frontend seperately if you want

Change your directory to server and type the following commands

For starting only the front-end server type ` npm run client ` and for starting only the back-end server, type ` npm run server `.

The front-end ` localhost:3000` uses proxy to the backend server ` localhost:5000` for easy API calling.


If you want to make contributions to this repo then make a seperate branch and apply the changes.

#### Thank you
